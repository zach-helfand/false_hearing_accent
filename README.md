# false_hearing_accent
repo for undergrad honor's thesis "false hearing and L2-accented sentences"

This repository contains organized data frame files which I used in my experiment.

Note: I have not included the R or Praat scripts I used (and referenced in my "materials" section, because they do not belong to me. General versions of all the R code used was passed down via the PsychLing lab pipeline (original author unknown to be honest) and I tweaked to fit my speficic demenads (mostly just organizing the data as I wanted it -- the outputs of which is in this repo). The Praat scripts came to be similarly and none of that code is my own, so I have not uploaded it here. A copy of the sentence set can be found in the appendix of the paper.
